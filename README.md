# chat_bot_project
📌 Description :-

This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) chatbot developed as part of a 4-week AICTE internship under Edunet Foundation. The chatbot is trained to understand user queries and provide relevant responses. It utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression for intent classification.

🚀 Features :-

✔️ Handles multiple intents like greetings, finance, investing, freelancing, negotiation, etc.
✔️ Uses TF-IDF to transform text data into numerical form.
✔️ Implements Logistic Regression for intent classification.
✔️ Tokenizes input using NLTK’s word_tokenize.
✔️ Built with Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used :-

📌 Python – Core programming language
📌 NLTK – Tokenization & text processing
📌 Scikit-learn – TF-IDF vectorization & Logistic Regression
📌 NumPy – Data manipulation
📌 Streamlit – Web app framework for chatbot UI
